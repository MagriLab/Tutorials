# Long Short-term Memory Network

## Description

This is an implementation of an Long Short-term Memory Network (LSTM) based on tensorflow.

## ** `lstm.py` **
This file contains the class implementation of the LSTM. 

## ** `lyapunov_tools.py` **
This file contains the methods to calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the LSTM.  

## ** models **
In the folder *models*,  you can find two trained LSTMs with hidden size 30 and 100. They can be directly loaded into LSTM_Tutorial_Lorenz63.ipynb.
